# Problem Statement
> The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim is to build a predictive model and predict the sales of each product at a particular outlet.

# About the dataset

- Item_Identifier=	Unique product ID
- Item_Weight	Weight= of product

# Executive Summary
1) Product Segmentation and Advertising -
  Companies spend a handsome amount of money on advertising for enhancing their turnover. Advertising should be considered on products based on their sales and profits per unit and in totality. With this the company can segment and segregate products. They could either use Pareto Analysis (80/20 Rule) for advertising or on the other hand they could increase advertising for low profitable products to enhance their sales.

2) Market Segmentation-
  By doing this they can apply Market Segmentation. Market segmentation gives a clear understanding of the retail customers' requirements. With the clear understanding of market segmentation, the retail managers and marketing personnel can develop strategies to reach out to the customers with specific needs and preferences.
